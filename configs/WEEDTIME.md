# searchTerms

> Search Terms are now more powerful. There are two types:
>
> - Pinned posts: links such as `https://bsky.app/profile/saddymayo.bsky.social/post/3jxju2wwap22e` will pin at the top of the feed. One link per line, please.
> - Keywords (maximum 5 terms): Test these in [https://bsky.app/search](https://bsky.app/search). `AND` is implicit, so `cat dog` on one line will require both `cat` and `dog`. You can use quotes as well `"hot dog"`.
